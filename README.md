## About Liberu Genealogy

Liberu Genealogy is a web application framework based on Laravel 11 using Filament and Livewire. 
With expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Liberu Genealogy takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://Liberu Genealogy.com/docs/broadcasting).

Liberu Genealogy is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
